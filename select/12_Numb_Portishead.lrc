[00:35.24] I'm ever so lost
[00:43.02] I can't find my way
[00:49.21] Been searchin', but I have never seen
[00:56.49] A turnin', a turnin' from deceit
[01:12.49] 
[01:02.12] 'Cause a child, roses light
[01:05.34] Tried to reveal, what I could feel
[01:22.34] 
[01:13.07] I can't understand myself
[01:19.06] Anymore
[01:25.02] 'Cause, I'm still feelin' lonely
[01:29.83] Feelin' so unholy
[01:38.33] 
[01:39.19] 'Cause a child, roses light
[01:43.60] Tried to reveal, what I could feel
[01:49.61] I'm lonely
[01:55.43] It just won't leave me alone
[01:58.76] Oh, no
[02:01.76] 
[02:04.17] (I think this is right)
[02:17.59] I'm foolin' somebody
[02:20.63] A faithless path, I roam
[02:25.88] Deceiving, to breathe this secretly
[02:32.58] The silence, the silence, I can't bear
[02:51.58] 
[02:39.86] 'Cause a child roses light
[02:43.63] Tries to reveal, what I could feel
[02:49.93] And this loneliness
[02:56.54] It just won't leave me alone
[03:00.47] Oh, no
[03:03.85] And this loneliness
[03:08.40] It just won't leave me alone
[03:22.40] 
[03:20.88] A lady of war
[03:29.54] A lady of war
